This project consisted of developing basic analysis skills using data specific programming language R and making use of various functions to provide in-depth 
instuctions on making the dataset more efficient and representative of the trends conforming to visuals and values. 
I started by looking at the initial exploratory analysis and then fitting and interpreting a linear regression model to accurately represent the dataset trends
and beginning to interpret values given by the summary function and specifically the residual standard error and why the model needed adjustments in order for 
accurate assumptions to be made. I then made changes to the included data by performing backwards stepwise selection and individually eliminating datapoints based
on the improvements made to the R-value which tells us the percentage of data lying between necessary bounds. 
After confirming the selected model gave the most accurate values and graphical depictions, I then assessed the validity of original assumptions and made 
comparisons to the new fitted model. Fitting a QQplot to the new linear model helped visualise whether the data can be normally distributed by plotting standardised 
residuals against fitted values and assesing the validity of model assumptions. Furthermore, after using the ANOVA function, I confirmed that the new model gave 
improved values for a more accurately fitting model and confirmed again with AIC values. 
I finished by finding 95% confidence intervals and stating the upper and lower bounds just to again confirm a normal distribution and that outliers within the 
data were minimised. Details of the lines of code are given by the hashtags above each given line.
